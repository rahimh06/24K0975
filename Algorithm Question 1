# Determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number and whether its even or odd
Start

Ask the user to enter a dividend
Ask the user to enter a divisor

Set quotient to dividend/divisor
Set number to 0

If quotient not = integer, then print divisor "is not a divisor" of dividend
If quotient = integer, then print divisor "is a divisor" of dividend
  Set number to quotient/2
  If number = integer, then print "quotient is an even number"
  If number not = integer, then print "quotient is an odd number"

End
